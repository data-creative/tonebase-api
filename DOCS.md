# Web Service Documentation

This document provides a reference for how the Client Application should expect to interface with the API Server.

NOTE: The API's current operating version is `v1`, so all endpoint URLs in this document assume a prefix of `/api/v1`.

## Requests

### POST Request Parameters

When issuing POST requests to a particular endpoint, pass parameters for the given resource nested inside an object named after that resource. For example, the request `POST api/v1/things` should pass a request body which resembles the following:

```` js
{
  thing: { // <-- name this object after the resource you are trying to create!
    name: "My Thing",
    description: "A thing."
  }
}
````

## Responses

The API uses the following HTTP response codes:

code | major status | minor status | description
--- | --- | --- | ---
200 | Success | OK | The resource(s) were returned successfully. Or the resource was updated successfully.
201 | Success | Created | The resource was created successfully.
204 | Success | No Content | The resource was destroyed successfully.
404 | Client Error | Not found | The resource wasn't found. Ensure the resource identifier is correct and other parameter values are valid.
422 | Client Error | Unprocessable | You tried to create or update a resource but something went wrong. Maybe there are validation errors.

### Error Messages

When there are Client Errors, the API also returns descriptive error messages, such as:

  + `{"id": ["not found"]}`
  + `{"name": ["can't be blank"]}`
  + `{"name": ["has already been taken"]}`
  + `{"advertiser"=>["can't be blank", "must exist"]}`
  + `{"price"=>["can't be blank", "is not a number"]}`
  + `{"role"=>["can't be blank", "is not included in the list"]}`
