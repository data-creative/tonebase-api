# Web Service Documentation

This document provides a reference for how the Client Application should expect to interface with the API Server. See also:

  + [Entity Relationship Diagram](/erd.png)
  + [Example Client Application (Express)](https://github.com/s2t2/tonebase-api-client-example)

## Requests

The API's current operating version is `v1`, so all endpoint URLs in this document assume a prefix of `/api/v1`.

### Authorization

The API only fulfills authorized requests. To send an authorized request, pass a valid client token in the request headers, for example:

    curl https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/hello -H 'Authorization: Token token="abc123"'

    curl https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/instruments -H 'Authorization: Token token="abc123"'

    curl https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/instruments -H 'Authorization: Token token="abc123"' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{"name":"My instrument","description":"Produces musical sounds."}'

    curl https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/users?email=search4me@gmail.com -H 'Authorization: Token token="abc123"'

### Pagination

By default, the API does not paginate responses.
However you can optionally request paginated responses from "List" endpoints
 by specifying **both** the `page` and `per_page` parameters.
For example, the following requests, in succession will return the first, second, and third pages of users, respectively, given a constant `per_page` value:

    curl https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/videos?page=1&per_page=5 -H 'Authorization: Token token="abc123"'

    curl https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/videos?page=2&per_page=5 -H 'Authorization: Token token="abc123"'

    curl https://tonebase-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/videos?page=3&per_page=5 -H 'Authorization: Token token="abc123"'

Except where otherwise noted, the API returns resources in ascending order of creation, so the first page will contain the oldest resources and the last page will contain the newest resources.

## Responses

The API uses the following HTTP response codes:

code | major status | minor status | description
--- | --- | --- | ---
200 | Success | OK | The resource(s) were returned successfully. Or the resource was updated successfully.
201 | Success | Created | The resource was created successfully.
204 | Success | No Content | The resource was destroyed successfully.
400 | Client Error | Bad Request | Make sure you are passing the correct URL parameters. If you are using pagination parameters, make sure you're using them both!
401 | Client Error | Unauthorized | The API requires you to pass an access token in the headers. Ensure you are passing a valid token.
404 | Client Error | Not found | The resource wasn't found. Ensure the resource identifier is correct and other parameter values are valid.
422 | Client Error | Unprocessable | You tried to create or update a resource but something went wrong. Maybe there are validation errors.

### Error Messages

When there are Client Errors, the API also returns descriptive error messages, such as:

  + `{"id": ["not found"]}`
  + `{"name": ["can't be blank"]}`
  + `{"name": ["has already been taken"]}`
  + `{"advertiser": ["can't be blank", "must exist"]}`
  + `{"price": ["can't be blank", "is not a number"]}`
  + `{"role": ["can't be blank", "is not included in the list"]}`
  + `{"pagination": ["when supplying pagination parameters, please use both 'page' and 'per_page'"]}``
